This repository contains some of the source code listings from Programming Principles and Practice 3rd Edition by Bjarne Stroustrup. There's also some exercise solutions as well. The examples and solutions are numbered and sequentially follow the listings in the chapter.

I wasn't planning on uploading this to GitHub but saw the book website didn't have the code available so I'm putting this online in the hopes that others find it useful.

> [!NOTE]
> This code doesn't match the book exactly as I didn't use the support library. I also use `#include` rather than `import` for the standard library because neither Clang nor GCC supported `import std;` when I was going through the book.

No build system is included as most examples can be simply built standalone. For building and running the GUI chapters, see the officially recommended https://github.com/villevoutilainen/ProgrammingPrinciplesAndPracticeUsingQt/.
